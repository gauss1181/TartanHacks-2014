Tourgeni.us
================
Holiday =/= Hellday. (see what we did there? :P)
  
Get your next vacation set up in less than 30 seconds!
  
All you have to do is tell us where you want to visit, when you plan to make your travels, and what your desired daily budgets are. From there, we will instantly design a neatly-planned itinerary (thanks to the help of several awesome APIs like Google Maps and Foursquare/Yelp) to help guide you on your tour.
  
Tourgeni.us is a TartanHacks 2014 project designed by CMU students Brian Ho, Chen Liu, & Megan Chen.
